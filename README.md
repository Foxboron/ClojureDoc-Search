ClojureDocSearch  
================  
  
**A ClojureDoc searcher inside of Sublime Text 2!**

    
You can use the keybind `ctrl+shift+c` to search a word, either by placing your cursor ontop of the word or by selecting it!  

You can also access the search function with a menu option called `Clj-Doc: Search` (Subject to change)  

If the search term got a 100% match in the docs you get straight too the terms menu, where you can view docs, view the source or examples and insert them into your code!  

There is also an option to see other topics of interest with `See Also...` option. The back function works for everything!

## Issues
 * Sublime Text 2's quick panel scales by the largest, gives an awkward view for several examples
